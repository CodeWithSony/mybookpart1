          <h1>Stories beneath the open sky...Truth can be fade away for a while but it will appear again.</h1>
          <p>During my childhood days i used to sleep in our rooftop with my Mumma and other siblings as well. In moonlight i used to do massage in my mumma's foot and she used to tell us a lot of stories. Those nights are just mindblowin seeing cluds and and moon as well. Moon used to walk slowly slowly. For a while it used to disapper because of clouds then it used to come back. I also remember my thoughts over aeroplanes. whenever in night 2 aeroplanes used to come from opposite direction like one was going from east and another was coming from west whenever they come close i used to watch them so keenly i thinking this time please both of them crash with each other so i can see patakha's like boom. But after coming near they used to pass each other without any explosion. Same things i was thinking when i was seeing any moving star. I was thining maybe this start will crash by that star but they used to pass each other everytimeðŸ˜…. I still used to remember a story of two blood related sisters who my mumma used to tell me in my childhood days.. They were so beautyfull but they were orphan. So they used to work by theirselves so they can have meal. Once they were in a way to collect woods so they can make fire and can cook later. But that was summer season so little sister was thirsty very much. So her big sister said there is a river let's go there. When the both children gone there the water became disapper. and that river became dry. After that a saint came throw any garment and water will come back. Then her big sister said to her younger sister. "Sis give me your ring i will throw it in the pond and when water will come back we will drink it" Then her younger sister did the same. But after drinking water younger sister said to her big sister, "I want my ring back". then elder sister replied, "How it's possible sis????ðŸ˜¥ i have thrown it to the river. If i go there to bring back to your ring i will be died" But she became stubborn and started crying so badly for the ring. So elder sister gone inside that deep river and she threw her sister's ring but because river was deep she died. And again her younger sister started crying and crying in the riverbank. Then a prince seen to the crying girl and because she was so beautyfull that prince asked her like, "I want to marry you." After that the crying girl became Queen. That king was already having 3 wives in his palace but they were not having any kids. Once when that new Queen get pregnant then that king said to her Queen as, "Whenever you feel delivery pain then use this bell and i will come back from anywhere" That bell was magical bell. Once when he gone to hunting the animals the Queen wanted to test the bell whether King will come back or not. Then after using that bell, King actually came. Then he asked "why you used that bell are you having delivery pain???" Then that queen replied no i was just testing the bell whether it's working or not. What if i will be in serious pain and you will not come back then????? Now i have belive on you, you will really come back in my hours of need. After that king again gone to hunting the animals. After some days she was really feeling delivery pain and when she used her bell that time King thought as "My queen is again playing game with me but this time i will not go and become full by her." Because all his 3 old queens were not having any kids they were feeling jealous of new queen and they thought as "If new queen's baby will come King will give all his wealth to that baby and we will become begger after that" By thinking like that they did delivery of new queen and when baby was coming they put queen's face in opposite direction so she can't she her baby. And when baby came they exchanged the baby with bricks and stones and threw the baby into the river inside which the new Queen's elder sister was died. AFter doing that all three old queens told the King like, "see your new queen gave birth to bricks and stones". After that the king became angry to her new Queen as it's like disgrace to me and he made her begger and even he banished her from his palace. 
                    After this in the village of that King suddnely everyone started talking about a beautyfull lotus flower in a the same river where the king's baby was thrown by all the three bad queens. That lotus was too beautyfull. whenever someone wanted to have that lotus that lotus flower used to go away in the deep water so no one was able to reach to that beautyfull lotus flower. That lotus flower also used to sing a song as "You make a horse by wood...that will graze green grass and it will excrete dry dung..." That flower used to sing this song again and again. 
                    When the king heard about such thing he gone into the river and when he tried to catch the flower then we also become succeeded on it. And in the root of that lotus flower a charming boy baby was there. Because the elder sister's soul of the new Queen was protecting her sister's baby. 
        But because that baby was unable to speak the King decided as "The woman who will be able to feed her milk to the baby that woman will be it's mother." Then every married woman tried to feed the baby but baby didn't used to drink milk from any of them. Now no woman left in the village to feed the baby. Then an old grandpa said there is still a woman who is in our village we should ask her to feed the baby. And that woman was the new Queen. When new started feeding the baby the baby started drinking and in the last they get to know that new Queen was actual mother of the baby. 
                     After that new queen told the whole story of her deliver like how all three old queens used to put her face in opposite direction and stole her baby and exchaged the baby with bricks and stones. But because that time i was not having any proof of my innocence i was unable to tell you truth. After hearing it The king said sorry to the new Queen and accepted her back and after that he gave order to dig 3 grave for the all three bad queens and buried them all.
